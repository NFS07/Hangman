# Hangman
This ia basic command prompt game written in python. It is called Hangman, and it is one of my first complete coding projects
This game is fairly simple, and you might have heard of it before.


Hangman is a word guessing game where you get 6 tries to guess a decoded word. Every turn you either get to choose a letter or a word.
If you decide to choose a letter, you can write it after the program says "Please guess a letter or a word".
When you pick a letter, you will recieve one of three responses:


  If you get the letter correct you will get the message "Good job, (letter) is in the word"
  then, the screen will update with the correct letter you picked in all of the places that this letter 
  should be in the word


  If you do not get the lettter correct, you will recieve the message "(letter) is not in the word",
  and when you get a letter incorrect, the image will update to a drawing of a person that has gained
  one of the following body parts:
  
    (in order)
    A head
    A torso
    Left hand
    Right hand
    Left foot
    Right foot (game over)

  However, if you guessed a letter that you already previously have, you will be informed with the message "(letter) is not in the word"
  and then you will be given another try (not adding any body parts)
  
  
Now, let's say you are confident enough with the revealed letters in the decoded word and you think that you have an idea of the word,
you can input a whole entire word, here are the two response you will recieve:

  If you guessed the correct word, you will recieve the uplifting message "Congrats, you got the right word! you win!!!"
  and this is how you win the game.
  
  if you dd not guess the correct word, you have nothing to lose since you will be granted another try, along with
  the message "Sorry but this is not a valid guess", so it would'nt hurt to use this option every now and then, since you have unlimited
  word guesses.
  
  
End of game:

  To recap, you can win the game by ultimately guessing the correct word (unlimited tries), although it is not as easy 
  as it sounds because there are hundreds of words in a seperate file that the AI picks randomly so you will need to guess
  a few letters first.
  You will lose the game if you guessed at least 6 different letters, and you got 6 of them wrong.
  A tip to get words correctly is just use some of the most common in the English alphabet like A,C,I,E,T.

By now, you probably know how to play, and what to expect from this tiny app. So good luck, and I hope you like this game.
